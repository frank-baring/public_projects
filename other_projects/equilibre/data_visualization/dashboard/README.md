Program names: EQU-201_tracking_script.R 

Programmer: Frank Baring

Description: A program that generates an excel dashboard, using patient data exported from an IBM data warehouse, designed to help with track drug efficacy in a stage 2 clinical trial.

Notes:
 - This was the script I used to extract and transform subject data from Equilibre's stage 2 clinical trial. 
 - Program will not run without dataset, which cannot be provided.
 - I have included this program in my public Github to showcase proficiency in R, rather than demonstrate functionality.
