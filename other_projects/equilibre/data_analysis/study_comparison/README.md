Program names: study_comp_merk.r

Programmer: Frank Baring

Description: A program that generates a shinyapps dashboard, designed to help compare one of Equilibre's clinical studies with a similar study conducted by Merck. The main purpose of the analysis was to observe differences between regression coefficients when neurotoxicity was plotted against dose level. The analysis included other features like age and degree of  comorbidity.

Notes:
 - Program will not run without dataset, which cannot be provided.
 - I have included this program in my public Github to showcase proficiency in R and shinyapps, rather than demonstrate functionality.
